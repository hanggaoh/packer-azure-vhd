# Hardening Guidelines for Azure Linux VHD

## Introduction
This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for hardening a Linux Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) intended for deployment in Microsoft Azure. The goal is to enhance the security posture of the image by implementing various hardening techniques.

## General Hardening Practices

1. **Minimize Installed Packages**
   - Remove unnecessary packages and services to reduce the attack surface.
   - Use minimal base images whenever possible.

2. **User Management**
   - Disable root login and use sudo for administrative tasks.
   - Implement strong password policies and enforce password expiration.

3. **Network Security**
   - Configure firewalls to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Disable unused network services and ports.

4. **System Updates**
   - Regularly apply security patches and updates.
   - Automate updates where feasible to ensure timely application.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Enable logging for all critical services and applications.
   - Implement centralized logging solutions for better monitoring.

## Specific Hardening Steps

### 1. File Permissions
- Ensure that sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`) have appropriate permissions.
- Regularly audit file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. SSH Configuration
- Change the default SSH port from 22 to a non-standard port.
- Disable password authentication and use SSH keys instead.

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Install and configure a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).
- Use tools like `fail2ban` to protect against brute-force attacks.

### 4. Application Hardening
- Regularly review and harden application configurations.
- Disable unnecessary features and services in applications.

### 5. Backup and Recovery
- Implement a robust backup strategy for critical data.
- Regularly test recovery procedures to ensure data integrity.

## Conclusion
Following these hardening guidelines will help ensure that the Linux VHD is secure and resilient against potential threats. Regular reviews and updates to the hardening practices are essential to adapt to evolving security challenges.
