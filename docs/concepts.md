# Basic Concepts of the Azure Packer Hardened VHD Project

## Overview
This project utilizes Packer to automate the creation of a hardened Linux Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) for deployment in Microsoft Azure. The process is integrated with a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the image is built, tested, and published efficiently and securely.

## Key Components

### Packer
Packer is an open-source tool that automates the creation of machine images. In this project, Packer is used to define the configuration for building a Linux VHD. The main components include:
- **Templates**: Define the base image and configurations for the build process.
- **Variables**: Allow customization of the build process through external parameters.
- **Provisioners**: Scripts that run during the image creation to install software and configure the system.
- **Post-processors**: Handle actions after the image is built, such as uploading to Azure.

### CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the VHD. It consists of:
- **Build Steps**: Triggered by code changes, these steps initiate the Packer build process.
- **Testing**: Automated tests validate the security and compliance of the built image using InSpec.
- **Publishing**: Once validated, the image is published to Azure for use in deployments.

### Image Hardening
Hardening refers to the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability. This project includes:
- **Ansible Playbooks**: Used to apply security configurations and best practices to the Linux image.
- **Validation Scripts**: Ensure that the final image meets the specified hardening requirements.

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust framework for creating and managing hardened Linux VHDs for Azure, leveraging the power of Packer and CI/CD practices to ensure security and efficiency in the deployment process.
